This combination makes Crochet nearly impossible to fade.</p><p></p><p>For those looking to save money on an SP2, Jacob Misiorowski stands out as an attractive option. The Cardinals rank 25th in wRC+ against right-handed pitchers and have the third-lowest ISO in the league in these matchups. At $8000, that's compelling value. While the strikeout upside might be limited, the other factors point strongly in our favor.</p><p></p><p>For those interested in narrative-driven plays, consider Clayton Kershaw in what could be his final start at Dodgers Stadium. The Giants strike out more frequently against lefties and have managed just an 88 wRC+ against them this season. Emotions will certainly run high for this game, which I believe works to our advantage. At just $7000, Kershaw deserves serious consideration.</p>"

Much like the past few days, the real problem is pricing. The Angels have the highest Top Stack rate by 2x, which isn't surprising. They're also the Top Value team of the day. The only other option in their range? Their opponents. The Rockies are second in both Top Stack and Top Value. Both teams comprise about 30% of all ownership. This is what happens when the matchup is Mitch Farris vs. Bradley Blalock.</p><p></p><p>The challenge with today's slate is that once you look beyond the Coors game, everything else looks identical. We have seven teams with a Stack Score in the 4s, plus another at 3.99. If you ignore the Coors game, you can take a few stands and feel confident about your chances if your selected team performs well.</p><p></p><p>If I'm looking for one team outside of Coors, I'm leaning toward the San Diego Padres this morning. Davis Martin poses no real threat. He surrenders significant power to lefties, which benefits Merrill, Sheets, O'Hearn, Cronenworth, and others. While the Padres haven't displayed as much power against righties as expected this season, they still maintain a 118 wRC+ against them. That's enough for me.</p>"
